Read more below.

### SRF Virus: Trending Now
This playlist consists of current trending songs that are played on the SRF Virus radio channel. 

The application adds songs to the playlist that are played at least three times within a week. 
If a song is not played at least three times during the following week, it will be removed from the playlist.

### SRF Virus: Top 100
This playlist consists of current top 100 most played songs on the SRF Virus radio channel.

The application increments the count of a song every time it's played. Then it sorts the songs by count
and those in the top 100 that aren't in the playlist yet are added. Every song beyond the top 100
is removed, if it's in the playlist. Also, if a song is not played anymore within two weeks, it's removed
as well.

### SRF Virus: Night Out
This playlist consists of current songs that are played on the SRF Virus radio channel during the 
"Night Out" program. The "Night Out" songs are played on Saturday between 20:00 and 23:59 (CET).

The application adds songs to the playlist that are played at least once within three weeks.
If a song is not played at least once during the next three weeks, it will be removed from the playlist.

## Application Flow

The application is scheduled to run every 15min and uses the SRGSSR Audio API to retrieve played songs
on the SRF Virus radio channel as well as the Spotify Web API to maintain the playlist itself.

The application follows these steps:

1. Get songs from the SRGSSR Audio API
2. Filter out songs received from the SRGSSR Audio API that are redundant from the last request
3. Search filtered songs on Spotify to get URI (song identifier)
4. Add songs if they meet the criteria for the respective playlist
5. Remove songs that don't meet the criteria anymore
